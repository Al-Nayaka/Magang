                Childhood
            </h2>
            <p>
                Carlsen was <strong>born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990</strong>[8][9] to Sigrun Øen (1963-2024), a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[10] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[11] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At <strong>two years</strong>, he could <strong>solve 500-piece jigsaw puzzles</strong>; at<strong> four</strong>, he <strong>enjoyed assembling Lego sets</strong> with instructions intended for children aged 10-14.

                Chess career
            </h2>
            <h3>
                2004
            </h3>
            <p>
                Carlsen <strong>made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13</strong>, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee.[33] He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško Pavasovič).[34] As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves.[35] His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the Washington Post, to give him the title "the Mozart of chess" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors).[36] Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings.[37] <strong>Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his sponsor.</strong>[38]

                In the <strong>Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked No.10 in the world</strong>, as well as the co-winner of the tournament.[44] In the semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship.[45] Anand won 3–1.[46]

                Carlsen <strong>modelled for G-Star Raw's Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler</strong>. The campaign was shot by Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn.[515] The campaign was coordinated with the RAW World Chess Challenge in New York, an event in which Carlsen played an online team of global chess players, who voted on moves suggested by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Hikaru Nakamura and Judit Polgár. Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves.[516] In February 2014, he appeared in G-Star Raw's Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.[517]

                In <strong>October 2013, Carlsen co-founded a company, Play Magnus AS, with Espen Agdestein and Anders Brandt</strong>. Based in Oslo, Norway, Play Magnus' first product was an iOS app, called Play Magnus, that allows the user to play a chess engine created using a database of thousands of Carlsen's recorded games from the age of five and up. Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.
